Rationale
=========

Becoming a professional musician/producer has a huge barrier to entry because

  - You need approximately 10-20 years of singing/instrument practice,

  - Good quality equipments are very expensive. We want robust but cheaper alternatives,

  - Making a living as a musician is hard. Only few make it big,

  - Using DAW software well has a steep learning curve along with knowledge of thousands of concepts.

We all love music, we listen to it, we dance to it, we connect with people around music.

We just don't know how to make music, that we could share with others, how to make our own songs.

We always wanted to play an instrument but never got the chance, or could make the time.

MusicLab Pro is here to make you a musician among the pros.
