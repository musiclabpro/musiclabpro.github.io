Rationale
+++++++++

- Becoming a professional musician/producer has a huge barrier to entry

  - You need approximately 10-20 years of singing/instrument practice

  - Good quality equipments are very expensive. We want robust but cheaper alternatives.

- Artists often get stuck in their own style and find it hard to break out of the rut.

- We travel a lot. It's hard to carry around equipment, but we often carry around a laptop. Inspiration can strike anytime.

- We want to take a 10 minute break and play some musical tunes, learn about scales, develop ear for intervals.
